CMSC 335 Final Project: February 29th Checker

Using Node, Express, MongoDB, and a Holiday API, I created a simple application that
tells users if a date that they provide is February 29th. While this is more or less
a joke, the application will also tell users if the date they entered corresponds to
a holiday. The app uses MongoDB to keep track of all the total counts of every date
checked on this site.
